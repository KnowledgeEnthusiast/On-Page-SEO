					<summary class="heading"><h3>What is <q>SEO</q> aka Search Engine optimisation?</h3></summary>
					<br><p class="meta-details">Search engine optimization (SEO) are the techniques used for the improvement of the quality and quantity of website traffic flow towards a particular website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as "natural" or "organic" results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic. Unpaid (natural) traffic may originate from different kinds of searches, including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines.<br><br>Also we can say that "Search Engine Optimization" is a process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings. Search engines crawl the web, following links from page to page, and index the content found. When you search, the search engine displays the indexed content.<br><br> Crawlers always follows absolute rules, so if you follow those rules properly and closely while implementing SEO for a website, then in that case we can say, you are providing your website the best chances of showing up among the first results, as well as increasing traffic and possibly revenue (for e-commerce and ads). Search engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines keep result ranking as a trade secret. SEO combines official search engine guidelines, empirical knowledge, and theoretical knowledge from science papers or patents. Visit given links to learn more about seo.<br><br> As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the computer-programmed algorithms that dictate search engine behavior, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine when websites rank higher on the search engine results page (SERP). These visitors can then potentially be converted into customers. <q><a class="btn" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO" target="">Source-1</a></q>,&nbsp;<q><a class="btn" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" target="">Source-2</a></q>,&nbsp;<q><a class="btn" href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs" target="">Source-3</a></q>,&nbsp;<q><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-on-page-seo-cheat-sheet/" target="">Source-4</a></q>.</p>

				<p class="meta-details">Canonical Tag is used for telling search engines that your specific URL is the master copy of a page. It prevents caused by duplicate content. Canonical Tags are the most important and basic part of Search Engine Optimization. rel=”canonical” link tag (canonical tag) is a tag used in the head section of HTML to indicate that a page overlaps another page. What is canonical text in SEO? In SEO, canonical tags are used to let Google know which version of the page you want to appear in search results, to consolidate link equity from the duplicate pages as well as to improve crawling and indexing of your website.<br><br>A canonical URL is the URL of the page that Google thinks is most representative from a set of duplicate pages on your site. For example, if you have URLs for the same page (example.com?dress=1234 and example.com/dresses/1234), Google chooses one as canonical. The pages don't need to be absolutely identical; minor changes in sorting or filtering of list pages don't make the page unique (for example, sorting by price or filtering by item color). The canonical URL can be in a different domain/server than a duplicate URL.<br><br>What is the main difference between a canonical tag and a redirect? Redirect is a directive (it literally directs you to another page) a canonical tag is only a hint to search engines. That's a key difference that explains when to use one vs the other. It's worth considering that whenever you use a canonical tag, a search engine may choose to ignore it. <q><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls" target="">Source-1</a></q>,&nbsp;<q><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls#rel-canonical-link-method" target="">Source-2</a></q>,&nbsp;<q><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j_hxBw5B4E" target="">Source-3</a></q>,&nbsp;<q><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny3fWnFqwAs" target="">Source-4</a></q>.</p>

				<p class="meta-details">Robots meta tags are used for controlling the behavior of search engine crawling and indexing. Crawling is a process which is done by search engine bots (crawlers/spiders which are nothing but automated programme or code that that always looks for the mentions of a particular website link in other websites) to discover publicly available web pages. Indexing means when search engine bots (aka automated AI code) crawl the web pages and saves a copy of all information on index servers and search engines show the relevant results on search engine when a user performs a search query.<br><br> Crawling is the discovery of pages and links that lead to more pages. Indexing is storing, analyzing, and organizing the content and connections between pages.A robots meta tag is an HTML snippet that tells search engine robots what they can and cannot do on a certain page. It lets you control crawling, indexing and how information from that page is displayed in the search results.<br><br> index,follow = index the page as well as follow the links. noindex,follow = dont index the page but  follow the links index,nofollow = index the page but dont follow the links. noindex,nofollow = dont index page, dont follow the links. all = same as index. follow none = same as noindex. nofollow It's placed into the &lt;head&gt; section of a webpage.<br><br> "Robots.txt" This file contains address of directories which should not be scanned by search engines. The meta name="robots" tag applies to all search engines, while the meta name="googlebot" tag is specific to Google. In the case of conflicting robots (or googlebot) meta tags, the more restrictive tag applies. For example, if a page has both the max-snippet:50 and nosnippet tags, the nosnippet tag will apply. The default values are index, follow and don't need to be specified.<br><br> Indexing is how search engines organize the information and the websites that they know about. Indexing is part of a normal search engine process – arguably the most important, because content that is not in the index has no possibility of ranking for a search result.

				<p class="meta-details">DNS-prefetch is an attempt to resolve domain names before resources get requested. This could be a file loaded later or link target a user tries to follow. The dns-prefetch keyword for the rel attribute of the <link> element is a hint to browsers that the user is likely to need resources from the target resource's origin, and therefore the browser can likely improve the user experience by preemptively performing DNS resolution for that origin.<br><br>When a browser requests a resource from a (third party) server, that cross-origin's domain name must be resolved to an IP address before the browser can issue the request. This process is known as DNS resolution. While DNS caching can help to reduce this latency, DNS resolution can add significant latency to requests. For websites that open connections to many third parties, this latency can significantly reduce loading performance.<br><br>The X-DNS-Prefetch-Control is an HTTP response type header that informs the browser whether DNS prefetch to be executed or not. Turning it on may not work as many browsers may not support it in all the situations. Turning it off should disable in all supported browsers. Most of the browsers will ignore this header as they don’t do DNS prefetching. File objects like style sheets, images, JavaScript, etc are pre-fetched in the background. Pre-fetching is done in the background as it is possible that the DNS will be handled by the time the specified items are needed or the user clicks a URL, this reduces latency.

				<p class="meta-details">The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph. For instance, this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have the same functionality as any other object on Facebook. While many different technologies and schemas exist and could be combined together, there isn't a single technology which provides enough information to richly represent any web page within the social graph.<br><br> The Open Graph protocol builds on these existing technologies and gives developers one thing to implement. Developer simplicity is a key goal of the Open Graph protocol which has informed many of the technical design decisions.<br><br>To turn your web pages into graph objects, you need to add basic metadata to your page. We've based the initial version of the protocol on RDFa which means that you'll place additional <q><strong>meta</strong></q> tags in the <q><strong>head</strong></q> of your web page. The four required properties for every page are:- og:title - The title of your object as it should appear within the graph, e.g., "The Rock". og:type - The type of your object, e.g., "video.movie".<br><br> Depending on the type you specify, other properties may also be required. og:image - An image URL which should represent your object within the graph. og:url - The canonical URL of your object that will be used as its permanent ID in the graph, e.g., "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/".

				<br><p class="meta-details">Miscellaneous Meta: Difference between <strong>meta-name</strong> vs <strong>meta-property</strong>. Difference Between Meta tag and Meta property: Basically meta name is the usual name which is very frequently used in HTML documents. So basically what is meta property? The property attribute comes from the RDFa which is in HTML5. So basically you can use meta property together on the same meta tag for example <strong>Meta-Name&nbsp;<small>&lt;meta name="description" content="description about the content"&gt;</small></strong>, <strong>Meta-Property&nbsp;<small>&lt;meta property="og:description" content="description about the content"&gt;</small></strong>.

That's why we also have a list of meta tags and html tags which are of lesser importance or no longer been functional anymore in todays date.
